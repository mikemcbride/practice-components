# Practice Components

This repo is for practicing building generic, tested UI components with Vue and Vite. Each component will have an associated test. The goal is to build a fairly simple UI component in about an hour using TDD. Here's how it should work:

-   if practicing within the time limit, start the timer :)
-   create the new component file
-   create the associated test file inside `__tests__`
-   start writing the tests. helps to start by writing some comments detailing the specs of what the component should do.
-   start running the tests in a separate terminal pane - vitest will automatically rerun the tests when files change.
-   once you have your test cases covered, go build the component.
-   once tests are all passing, or if you need to view something, you can add the component to `HomeView.vue`

The goal of these components is that they should all be simple enough to complete within about 45-60 minutes. Styling is not super important, we're focused on building functional components.
